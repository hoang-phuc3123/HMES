### Hydroponic Monitoring Equipment System (HMES) Project

Welcome to the Hydroponic Monitoring Equipment System (HMES) project! This README provides an overview of our system, its functionalities, technologies used, and links to relevant repositories.

#### Overview

HMES is a comprehensive platform designed to support hydroponic enthusiasts with advanced monitoring and management capabilities. It consists of:

* **Sales Website**: An e-commerce platform where users can purchase IoT-enabled hydroponic kits and related products. These kits facilitate real-time monitoring of crucial indicators such as pH levels, water temperature, solute concentration, and water levels.

* **Admin Management**: A robust backend system for administrators to manage products, view support requests, monitor revenue, and oversee user activities.

* **Customer Support System**: A customer-centric support interface for handling technical and purchase-related inquiries. Customers can submit support requests based on their purchase status.

* **Mobile Application**: A mobile app for users to receive real-time notifications about their hydroponic systems, ensuring prompt updates and alerts.

#### User Roles

HMES supports various user roles with specific permissions and functionalities:

1. **Guests**: Visitors who can browse products and equipment on the sales website but cannot make purchases or submit support requests without logging in.

2. **Customers**: Logged-in users who can make purchases, submit support requests related to purchases, and manage their account details.

3. **Device Owners**: Customers who have purchased hydroponic kits and can access advanced features such as technical support, device connectivity, and real-time data viewing.

4. **Admins**: Administrators with full control over the system, including product management, support ticket handling, revenue tracking, and user management.

5. **Consultants**: Staff members responsible for handling support requests related to purchases, orders, and product inquiries.

6. **Technicians**: Equally empowered with consultants, technicians manage equipment-related issues, warranties, and maintenance tasks.

#### Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Developed using C# for robust and scalable backend functionalities.
* **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server for efficient data storage and management.
* **Frontend**: Next.js, React for web interfaces, and Flutter for mobile application development, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
* **Cloud Services**: Firebase for seamless integration of cloud-based functionalities.
* **Third-Party Services**: PayOS for secure payment processing and GHN for reliable delivery services.

#### Repositories
In this project, I was responsible for multiple key components across different platforms:

**Backend Development**: I developed the core backend functionalities using C# and Microsoft SQL Server, specifically focusing on:
- Admin management system for product oversight and user administration
- Customer support system for handling technical and purchase-related inquiries
- Shopping cart functionality for seamless e-commerce operations

**Frontend Development**: I created the admin dashboard using Next.js and React, providing administrators with comprehensive tools for:
- Product, category management and the plant - target value that the IOT device support.
- Support ticket handling and customer service oversight
- Revenue tracking and business analytics
- User management
- Enhance UI for product list in E-commerce website

**Mobile Development**: I implemented real-time notification features using Flutter:
